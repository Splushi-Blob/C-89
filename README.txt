SAVE OFTEN 
This is a fan game, meaning I'm not a professional. There may be things I missed in testing that could mess your game up. I've done the best I can so far, but there always could be a hidden bug. Just be weary.

WARNING IF YOU ARE UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION SAVE FILE
The save file from the 1.6.1 demo is NOT compatible, and will have several bugs and oddities. Please start a new game.

Upon final release, I hope to not have to make too many changes. The plan is that in updates/dlc, saves should transfer over. But for some reason when things are updated a bit too much, save files can start to have errors. So just remember to save often, I will do my best to make it so saves carry over in future versions, but no promises.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FAQ/Bugs--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#####################################################################################################################################################

Q: Where do I go after __? Where do I find _? How do I evolve __? etc.
A: Play the game. If you explore enough and interact with things enough, you will naturally find the answers to your questions. We are not here to hold your hand, because you should not need your hand held. So try to refrain from asking questions like that unless you have exhausted all your other options.

I designed this game to reward your curiosity and promote discovery. Just play the game.


Q:What emulator do I use? Can this be played on Mac?
A: None, this can only be played on a Windows operating system. After extracting the download, open the game folder, then open the Game.exe (little galaxy pokeball icon). It runs by itself.

Q: Are there Mega Evolutions? Randomizer mode? Nuzlocke mode? Following Pokemon?
A: No.

Q: What are the shiny odds?
A: ~1/3000, and nothing is shiny locked.

Q: What about ability capsules or nature mints?
A: Also no. But there is a nature changer in Hazeport. There's also an ability changer in the post-game.

Q: How rare are Hidden Abilities?
A: There is a 1/200 chance of a wild encounter having it, but roaming overworld encounters are far more likely to have them. The chance increases as you collect badges, as well.

Q: How do I update my game?
A: Your save is located in a different location, so you can just delete the old versions folder, then download and extract the new one.

Q:Where is my save file?
A: C:\Users[User Name]\Saved Games\Pokémon Infinity
Q: How long/ how many badges are there?
A: 5 badges and a four person tournament. Then, if you make the right decision, there is post-game content. Average play time has been ~20 hours, ~30-40 with post-game.

Q: Where is Astral Stone and Miracle Seed?
A: Searidge Town, after you get Cut

Q: How do I make the game full screen?
A: You can't. There are 3 window size options in the game that you can access from the options menu, full screen is unfortunately not one of them.

Q: When do you get the Exp. Share?
A: You get the Exp. Router shortly after the first badge. 

Q: What Pokemon are all in this game?
A: 1st through 6th gen, and 100+ new fakemon. Here's the dex, beware spoilers. https://p-infinity.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex

Q: Can I use __ for my own project?
A: Consider everything private, but if you want to use something, I'm open to discuss it. I can be pretty open with tiles and other resources, but some stuff I want to keep private for Infinity. So just contact me if there's something you want to use, I may be more generous than you'd expect.

Q: Is there a speed-up button? 
A: Yes, use Ctrl to cycle through 3 speed options (normal/fast/faster) Use with caution, speed up functions may cause unexpected gameplay issues.


Q: Are the key layouts customizable?
A: No, but I would just use an app called JoyToKey, it allows you to set up custom configurations for any apps/controllers. https://joytokey.net/en/

Q: Is there a wiki?
A: It is very new and in development, any help with filling it out would be appreciated.
https://p-infinity.fandom.com/wiki/Pokemon_Infinity_Wiki

Q: Can I play this on my phone?
A: There is an app called JoiPlay that is able to play on Android phones with minimal issues.
